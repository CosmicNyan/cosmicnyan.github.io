      <h1>The RGB List</h1>

      <h2>quick prelude</h2>
      <p>
        Okay so basically some baldi lore people noticed that "pure" shades of the colors Red Green and Blue appear together in a lot of contexts. i originally didn't think any of this until Chex (cheatexp) came up with a theory that actually gives the color pairing meaning instead of just pointing at it and saying it exists. their theory is <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/cheatexp/774425921000226816/unity-theory?source=share">here</a> if you wish to read it, but the gist of its interpretation of RGB is that they both correspond to the characters NULL, Baldi, Badsum, and to verticality based on the placeholder tiles (Down, "Walls" and Up), and that it means all three of the characters need to work together to uncorrupt the game. There's also evidence of 99 being associated with yellow, as a separate but adjacent thing to RGB.<br><br>
        I really like this idea , but also i think it'd be useful to compile all instances of RGB so that it's easier for people to draw their own conclusions about RGB in the context of Baldi's Basics. so here's that<br><br>
        BTW there's a "brainrot meter" inspired by Andrew Cunningham's Gaster motif video. the further to the left the brainrot meter is, the more likely i think it is to be intentional (not specifically to chex's interpretation, just in general,) although there's doubt with all of these since there hasn't been any direct confirmation that RGB means anything unlike 99. I just think this meter is useful to have as I will be including *every instance* of these colors together.

        <br><br><br>
        now, in rough chronological order,
      </p>

          <p>
            Starting off "Strong" with the design of baldi himself. <br>
            lips: red <br>
            shirt: green <br>
            pants: blue <br>
            it is the correct order but also this is a ridiculous enough connection and if it's intentional then like. what<br>
            we will bring up his design later since it got very subtly changed in 0.9, but for now this is peak brainrot. moving on

            this poster is featured in two places: the glitched school and bb+ floor 3 <br>
            the glitched school is very tied to 99 which is interesting, though idk what to think of it being in floor 3 if it's a lore thing <br>
            under the chex interpretation of rgb i find it weird how "YOU WILL NEVER LEAVE" is like... it just doesn't fit for null to me he still seems somewhat hopeful at this point in the story, hence why this has some Brainrot on the meter even though it's very lore-y. still though this does feel important. it's a very weird asset especially in the context of plus, i wouldn't be surprised if it gets contextualized later and the colors are a part of that.<br>
            btw even though you can never see it in this context, the secret message being red means that it's the only thing you'd be able to see in the red school. so that's funky

          <p>
            So like. It's intentional <br>
            It's the logo. he got a professional logo designer to make this <br>
            At the very least, even if there's no deep lore stuff with RGB, this makes me believe Mystman includes the colors on purpose to represent the fact the game's lore is canonically a game. Since the most obvious connection RGB has to anything is the fact it's how monitor pixels work, with three subpixels in those colors. <br><br>
            Also, yellow (99) being separate from the RGB strips fits so well??? 99 is outside of the main world of the game. it's just forced its way into here. lurking over everything. or something like that <br>
            0 brainrot. this is my truth

          <p>
            when the level is generating, floors, walls, and ceilings start out with these placeholder textures that are colored with RGB. <br>
            you can also see these placeholder textures in the glitched school of bbcr, with one room having a cube made of the textures and another room being entirely made out of them and containing a crying baldi you can only access once the red baldloons have started destroying the school.<br><br>

            as for my thoughts on it in regard to lore: eeuhhhhhhh?????? <br>
            so like. these <i>are</i> placeholder assets<br>
            and like. yeah they are actually a part of the game in bbcr but<br>
            even though they're part of a theory i really like, a part of me just thinks "does this actually mean anything" <br>
            the interpetation of it is really cool though. so it's not complete brainrot. and they are in the trailer for baldi's basics plus so i wouldn't be surprised if they appear as an intentionally visible part of the game again

              finally a juicy steak to crunch on. wwaait i don't think steak should be cr<br><br>
              okay. so in the party style ending, a bunch of red baldloons appear and fly all over the place and destroy the school. <br>
              then it cuts to this screen. red, blue, and green text separately says the same thing.<br>
            </p>
              <p style="color: red">THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT</p>
              <p style="color: green">THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT</p>
              <p style="color: blue">THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT</p>
            <p>
              the theory says this is NULL, Baldi, and "Badsum" talking. and i believe them <br>
              I mean, both Baldi and NULL are portrayed as being distressed during the baldloon invasion. Baldi's crying and NULL freaks out if you talk to him during the event. We don't see Badsum's reaction but considering how he's generally distressed whenever the game's broken I think it's a good inference to assume he also isn't very happy about this.<br>
              0 brainrot here. just peak writing

            <p>
              oughhhh okay. <br>
              So, in the NINENINE Secret there's a lot of text. some of this text is in a different color, and those colors are RGB <br>
              <span style="color: red">Red</span> is used when threatening the player in the "YOU ARE <span style="color: red">DOOMED</span>" and <span style="color: red">LIAR</span> text <br>
              <span style="color: blue">Blue</span> is in the entire section describing Badsum <br>
              and <span style="color: green">Green</span> is used when talking about "<span style="color: green">BALDIS BASICS T</span>"... and for the word "<span style="color: green">BUT</span>"? weird <br><br>
              anyways. the use of blue and green to associate with Badsum and Baldi is obvious here. <br>
              the red fits a bit less but there's also this pattern of 99-adjacent stuff using red too just because it's scary (red baldloon... this text... the failure message in ninenine... something else probably) so it can be justified like that but that still weakens the connection. <br>
              still though these color choices are very intentional and lore-y so low brainrot levels here
