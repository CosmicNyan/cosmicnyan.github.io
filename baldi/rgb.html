      <h1>The RGB List</h1>

      <h2>quick prelude</h2>
      <p>
        Okay so basically some baldi lore people noticed that "pure" shades of the colors Red Green and Blue appear together in a lot of contexts. i originally didn't think any of this until Chex (cheatexp) came up with a theory that actually gives the color pairing meaning instead of just pointing at it and saying it exists. their theory is <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/cheatexp/774425921000226816/unity-theory?source=share">here</a> if you wish to read it, but the gist of its interpretation of RGB is that they both correspond to the characters NULL, Baldi, Badsum, and to verticality based on the placeholder tiles (Down, "Walls" and Up), and that it means all three of the characters need to work together to uncorrupt the game. There's also evidence of 99 being associated with yellow, as a separate but adjacent thing to RGB.<br><br>
        I really like this idea , but also i think it'd be useful to compile all instances of RGB so that it's easier for people to draw their own conclusions about RGB in the context of Baldi's Basics. so here's that<br><br>
        BTW there's a "brainrot meter" inspired by Andrew Cunningham's Gaster motif video. the further to the left the brainrot meter is, the more likely i think it is to be intentional (not specifically to chex's interpretation, just in general,) although there's doubt with all of these since there hasn't been any direct confirmation that RGB means anything unlike 99. I just think this meter is useful to have as I will be including *every instance* of these colors together.

            Starting off "Strong" with the design of baldi himself. <br>

            shirt: green <br>
            pants: blue <br>
            it is the correct order but also this is a ridiculous enough connection and if it's intentional then like. what<br>
            we will bring up his design later since it got very subtly changed in 0.9, but for now this is peak brainrot. moving on

            this poster is featured in two places: the glitched school and bb+ floor 3 <br>
            the glitched school is very tied to 99 which is interesting, though idk what to think of it being in floor 3 if it's a lore thing <br>
            under the chex interpretation of rgb i find it weird how "YOU WILL NEVER LEAVE" is like... it just doesn't fit for null to me he still seems somewhat hopeful at this point in the story, hence why this has some Brainrot on the meter even though it's very lore-y. still though this does feel important. it's a very weird asset especially in the context of plus, i wouldn't be surprised if it gets contextualized later and the colors are a part of that.<br>
            btw even though you can never see it in this context, the secret message being red means that it's the only thing you'd be able to see in the red school. so that's funky

            So like. It's intentional <br>
            It's the logo. he got a professional logo designer to make this <br>
            At the very least, even if there's no deep lore stuff with RGB, this makes me believe Mystman includes the colors on purpose to represent the fact the game's lore is canonically a game. Since the most obvious connection RGB has to anything is the fact it's how monitor pixels work, with three subpixels in those colors. <br><br>
            Also, yellow (99) being separate from the RGB strips fits so well??? 99 is outside of the main world of the game. it's just forced its way into here. lurking over everything. or something like that <br>
            0 brainrot. this is my truth

          <p>
            when the level is generating, floors, walls, and ceilings start out with these placeholder textures that are colored with RGB. <br>
            you can also see these placeholder textures in the glitched school of bbcr, with one room having a cube made of the textures and another room being entirely made out of them and containing a crying baldi you can only access once the red baldloons have started destroying the school.<br><br>

            as for my thoughts on it in regard to lore: eeuhhhhhhh?????? <br>
            so like. these <i>are</i> placeholder assets<br>
            and like. yeah they are actually a part of the game in bbcr but<br>
            even though they're part of a theory i really like, a part of me just thinks "does this actually mean anything" <br>
            the interpetation of it is really cool though. so it's not complete brainrot. and they are in the trailer for baldi's basics plus so i wouldn't be surprised if they appear as an intentionally visible part of the game again

                finally a juicy steak to crunch on. wwaait i don't think steak should be cr<br><br>
                okay. so in the party style ending, a bunch of red baldloons appear and fly all over the place and destroy the school. <br>
                then it cuts to this screen. red, blue, and green text separately says the same thing.<br>

              <p>
                the theory says this is NULL, Baldi, and "Badsum" talking. and i believe them <br>
                I mean, both Baldi and NULL are portrayed as being distressed during the baldloon invasion. Baldi's crying and NULL freaks out if you talk to him during the event. We don't see Badsum's reaction but considering how he's generally distressed whenever the game's broken I think it's a good inference to assume he also isn't very happy about this.<br>

              In Baldi's Basement, there's a bunch of books that all have the same text inside but have different covers. <br>
              The first three use RGB, with 1 being red, 2 being green, and 3 being blue. <br>
              The next three use CMY (the inverse of RGB), but it's not in the right order there. <br>
              I personally don't think much of these being RGB, though I do think it's weird how he says "Don't pay attention to anything, that's how the pros win!" in the books. but that's unrelated to it being RGB.... i think<br>
              The association of 1 as red, 2 as green, and 3 as blue is the biggest takeaway for me, since this association is later reused in the map markers and Laboratory posters.

              In the Basically Games Website, the colors Red, Green, and Blue are used for different sections in order throughout most pages, with Yellow being an accent color. <br>
              I don't feel like going through each page and analyzing the symbolism of which colors are included and where, but it's definitely intentional. it's literally the brand colors

            <p>
              oughhhh okay. <br>
              So, in the NINENINE Secret there's a lot of text. some of this text is in a different color, and those colors are RGB <br>
              <span style="color: red">Red</span> is used when threatening the player in the "YOU ARE <span style="color: red">DOOMED</span>" and <span style="color: red">LIAR</span> text <br>
              <span style="color: blue">Blue</span> is in the entire section describing Badsum <br>
              and <span style="color: green">Green</span> is used when talking about "<span style="color: green">BALDIS BASICS T</span>"... and for the word "<span style="color: green">BUT</span>"? weird <br><br>
              anyways. the use of blue and green to associate with Badsum and Baldi is obvious here. <br>
              the red fits a bit less but there's also this pattern of 99-adjacent stuff using red too just because it's scary (red baldloon... this text... the failure message in ninenine... something else probably) so it can be justified like that but that still weakens the connection. <br>
              still though these color choices are very intentional and lore-y so low brainrot levels here

              same numbers as the books, and same pins from the conspiracy board, except now there's also letters with the opposite CMY colors. idk if CMY is meant to mean anything but it's worth noting<br>
              anyways. the color choice is intentional since he's using the inverse colors too but i have no idea how this would be Important in any way so middle of the road brainrot here

              in the third basically games podcast, he said this was intentional and it's lore. i don't even know man <br>

              in the 0.10 lab, there's posters that tell you which zone of the lab you're in. these use the number associations established earlier <br>
              1 is red, 2 is blue, and 3 is green, <br>
              and 4 is yellow? <br>
              the lab is likely associated with quantum shenanigans considering those have now been established with The Test, so i think it's interesting how that pairs with the idea of RGB representing these characters from different games, since cartoon logic often dictates quantum mechanics let you travel to different dimensions somehow. idk how/if that plays with anything though

              Student_0 uses the RGB colors. they aren't in order but they're there <br>
              green feels like a weird shoe color to me so i won't totally discount it but if this is intentional it tells me that RGB means something different than Unity Theory suggests. <br>

            All the 99s that appear before the terminal pops up are yellow. the sprite in the game's files is white, so he recolored it to be yellow using a shader ingame on purpose <br>
            this is where the idea of 99 being yellow comes from. zero brainrot since he did it on purpose, it's not any more/less readable than if it was a different color

            i'm breaking chronological order because starting with the banana would make me sound more stupid than starting with baldi's design did <br>
            this banana sprite appears in a few places. it was made for Null's secret ending in classic, then it reappears as generic decoration in later games, and finally it's used as a weapon against Null in BBCR's Null Style. <br>
            Since the origin of 99 is a Donkey Kong Country corruption, and bananas are heavily associated with Gorillas, I believe the bananas are meant to be related to 99, not to NULL. And the fact they're yellow adds on to this, even if retroactively.

            there's a non-canon ARG ran by Anthony Hampton, the composer of Schoolhouse Trouble. Smalldi is a character in this ARG, and Anthony has stated several times that Smalldi is the only canon part of it. i don't.  i don't evenk <br>
            Smalldi opposes NULL which makes Smalldi feel close to 99 to me. and now 99 is associated with yellow, the color of smalldi's shirt <br>
            also some people think that the creepy face from the ninenine secret is smalldi. so. idk. 40% brainrot here
