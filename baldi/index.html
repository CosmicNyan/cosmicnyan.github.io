            For a while i've kept my thoughts on baldi ""lore"" in the wiki server or sometimes, <b>sometimes,</b> i'd put them in a google doc. <br>
            i don't want to keep using google docs so i'm gonna put some future stuff here<br>
            <br>
            for now though the only thing is a list of RGB instances for documentation sake<br>
            maybe that'll be interesting to you? <br>
